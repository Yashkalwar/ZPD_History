## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- An OpenAI API key (get one at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/))
- Basic knowledge of command line/terminal

### Step 1: Get the Code
First, clone this repository to your computer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alevel-history-assistant.git
cd alevel-history-assistant
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment** (keeps your project dependencies organized):
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your API key**:
   - Create a new file called `.env` in the project folder
   - Add your OpenAI API key like this:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     ```

### Step 3: Start Learning!

#### Option 1: Command Line Interface (For Quick Use)
```bash
python main.py
```

#### Option 2: Web Interface (More Interactive)

1. **Initialize the Database** (run once):
   ```bash
   # In the project directory
   python create_sample_data.py
   ```
   This will set up the initial database with sample data

2. **Start the Backend API** (in a terminal):
   ```bash
   # In the project directory
   uvicorn quiz_api:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the FastAPI backend with auto-reload enabled

2. **Start the Frontend** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   # In the project directory
   streamlit run streamlit_frontend.py
   ```
   This will automatically open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

> **Note**: Make sure both the backend and frontend are running for full functionality. The frontend depends on the backend API to work properly.
